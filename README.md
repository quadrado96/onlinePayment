# Contract Processing Automation

## Project Overview

This project is designed to automate the processing of contracts for a company. The contract processing involves generating the payment installments based on the desired number of months.

The company uses an online payment service to handle the payment of the installments. Typically, online payment services charge a monthly interest rate, as well as a payment fee. Currently, the company uses the PayPal service, which applies a simple interest of 1% per installment, in addition to a payment fee of 2%.

## Requirements

The program should:

1. Read the contract details (contract number, contract date, and total contract value).
2. Read the number of months for the contract installment plan.
3. Generate the payment records (date and value) for the installments. 
    - The first installment is due one month after the contract date, the second installment two months after the contract date, and so on.
4. Display the installment details on the screen.

## Example

Given the contract details and a number of months for installment, the program will calculate and display each installment with the appropriate interest and payment fee applied.

## Installation

To use this program, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the source code to run the program.
